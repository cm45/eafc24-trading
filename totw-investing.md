# TOTW Investing

Basically you're stocking up on TOTW's that are decently priced and playable and at least 40-50k and buy them during their lowest point of the week. Usually that's on Saturday night `01:00 - 04:00`. If that's too late for you you might also make a solid profit if you buy those cards on Friday `23:00 - 24:00`, although the profit margins are usually a bit lower.

The reason for this is that the supply is usually the highest at that point and the demand is the lowest. So you're able to get the cards for a good price and sell them for a profit during the week. Preferably on Tuesday.

The Friday drop is usually quite visible on the 14 days (Hourly) graph on FutBin, so you can take it as a reference point. Also compare it with other players of previous weeks if you're unsure.

It might be worth holding if you see a leak about an upcoming SBC that links well to the player you're holding. But be careful with that, if you don't trust the leak.
