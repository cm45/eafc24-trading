# Tools

## Websites
* [FutBin](https://www.futbin.com/) for player prices, SBC solutions and more

## Browser Extensions
* [FUT Enhancer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fut-enhancer/boffdonfioidojlcpmfnkngipappmcoh) for WebApp enhancements. I don't recommend using the auto buyer, but the highlight bargains and FutBin price implementation as well as the fullscreen and grid layout are great.

## Apps
TODO: No apps yet, but I'm sure there are some good ones out there.
