# Flipping
Flipping with "buy now" is a method I am rarely using. Basically you want to have a decent filter, so you're able to go to the 59th minute somewhat quickly and snatch good deals there and sell them for a profit right away. 

This method is quite time consuming and you need to be quick to get the good deals. I'm not using this method a lot, but it's a good way to make coins without much risk involved if you're focusing on fodder that will be needed for SBCs soon.

It's a solid method to use while waiting for your bids to go through.
