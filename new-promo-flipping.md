# New Promo Flipping
This trading method is pretty risky, but probably the most profitable one. For a better overview check out the prices of all META cards during the first hours of the new promo.

After roughly an hour the prices are usually at a low point. This is the time to buy. Sometimes the prices will go up again after a few minutes or an hour. You're best of just selling them instantly for a nice profit and enjoy your jackpot. Never gamble with the "will this card go up higher again?" mindset. You'll most likely regret it.

Also take a look at the first hours of the [Trailblazers Griezmann](https://www.futbin.com/24/player/19780/antoine-griezmann). He had the same drop as the other META cards of that promo, but never really bounced back. That's the risk you're taking. Check out the last promo and see how the prices of the META cards developed to get a better understanding of the risk you're taking and the possibilities you're gaining.
