# Low Rated META Trading
I would completly avoid this method. 85's and lower golds will continue dropping as supply increases and demand decreases. The only way to make profit with this method is to buy a card that is currently in packs and sell it when it's out of packs.

At the start of the game those cards had quite a few price crashes but rebounded later, which was a decent opportunity to make some profit.

Prices for them might spike a bit after new content is released and that card is a great link to the new content. Only do that if the are not too many alternatives to link the new card with your low rated meta card.
