# Live Card Promos Investing
Most of the times this is a fairly risk free investment method. It mainly consists of buying live players at their lowest and wait a few days/weeks for their heighest.

## When to buy
Usually the best time to buy is when the promo is about to end. This is when the supply is at its highest and the demand is at its lowest. Sometimes depending on the market situation the price of the card you want to invest in might even drop a bit more after the promo ends. If leaks for the next promo already showed content that will link link great with the card you want to invest in, it might be a good idea to buy a bit earlier.

## When to sell
Selling in the hype is usually the best and safest option.

Let's take the RTTK promo as an example:
It takes 2 wins to get one upgrade. Cards that are already on 1/2 wins are the most desirable and generate the most hype. Up until the deciding match starts the hype will be at its highest. This is the best time to sell.

The same concept will also apply to cards when they're only missing a win or draw to reach their next upgrade through advancing to the knockouts.

Often enough (especially with OTW previously) the cards drop in price after the upgrade many people are selling their investments and the supply is at its highest, so it's best to sell before the game.
