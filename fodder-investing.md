# Fodder Investing
Fodder investing is generally a safe and very profitable method, but is limited by current status of content in the game.

The span between the start of the game and the first few big SBC's is usually the best time to invest in fodder.

Looking at the market index on FutBin for the specific rating of fodder you want to invest in is a good way to determine if it's a good time to invest.

## When to invest
The best time to invest in fodder is when the market index is at it's lowest. This is usually the case when there's no new worthwile SBC's.

## When to sell
The best time to sell fodder is when the market index is at it's highest. This is usually the case when there are new worthwile SBC's.

## What to invest in
Fully depends on the amount of coins you have and the best index at the time of investing. If you have a ton of coins investing into 83's an 84's and maybe even 85's doesn't make sense as you don't have unlimited space on your transfer list.

## What to do if you're stuck with fodder
If you're stuck with fodder you can either sell it for a loss or wait for the next promo to come out and hope that the market index will rise again.
