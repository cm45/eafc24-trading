# Main Team
For gold meta players, they usually drop in price late on Wednesday and Thursday and have their lowest usually on Thursday morning. They then rise until Friday night and drop a bit on Saturday morning/noon. Afterwards they keep rising until late Tuesday or early Wednesday again.

> Prices and timings can always fluctuate, so it's best to check the prices of your players before buying them. Also be careful about promo card players and players that will receive a special card (More on that further down on this page). Keep your eyes open for leaks.

## Buying
There are multiple buy windows and it usually depends on the player in question as well as the released and upcoming content.

You can buy your players on `Wednesday around content release` (but be careful about TOTW players that link decently to the player you're intending to get, as that will increase demand). Prices will usually rise until Friday noon, but not by too much. Afterwards they'll rise.

You'll have another window from `Saturday 00:00 to 12:00` where you can get your players for a decent price. This window fits decently if you play FUT Champions on Saturday/Sunday, especially when you are intending to use your coins for trading in the mean time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
Be careful about cards related to the new promo release.
Example: Trailblazers
Trailblazers released with a Rodrygo SBC, which was the first decent player SBC of the year. Madrid is a big club with many fans, so there were a lot of players completing the SBC. They will also need related meta players in a similar price region to link them with their new card. So players like Gold Bellingham and RTTK Modric rose a lot. Especially because those two went out of packs as well.

## Selling
Selling them during Tuesday is usually the best and might even give you a profit. Selling them on Monday and going for other trading methods is also a valid alternative.
